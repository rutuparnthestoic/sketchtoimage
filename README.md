# Sketch To Colored Image Translation using GANs

A Deep learning project using PyTorch that translates a sketch(black and white) image to a colored image using PyTorch.

## Get Started

To run the project - 
1. Download the dataset 'AnimeSketchColorizationPair' from Kaggle and store it on a drive.
2. Run 'sketch_to_image_final.ipynb' on local environment(if powerful GPU is available) or on Google Colab using T4. It took me 11 Hours and 58 minutes for 68 epochs.
3. Get the saved model 'state_dict.pt' and make some changes in the app.py accordingly.
4. Run 'app.py'.

## Tech Stack 

1. PyTorch : For Deep learning libraries and functionalities.
2. Flask : For web integration
